This example creates a new description item and imports each comparative study plot (CSP) the import file as a separate sampling event and appends all associated data lines as sampling units. In DiversityDescriptions create the project  "Biomass as description" and a descriptor tree with the same name. In the "Matrix Wizard" select the target "Sampling event", open the data file BEFCHINAhlpbiomass_Import_Table.txt and use import schema BEFCHINAhlpbiomass_S_Import_Schema.xml.
