This import schema was created for the import of digitised herbarium sheets from different bavarian herbariums for the project "Flora von Bayern". For more information visit http://www.bayernflora.de/web/

The import table includes the following information:
- Specimen Acc. No.
- Exsiccata
- Location (Collection date, locality description, habitat, altitude, MTB)
- Identifications (up to three possible identifications containing: identification date, responsible)
- Collector name (up to three possible collectors)
-	Responsible for the data entry, date and comments

Any other information that is not included in the defined columns should be added to the free columns at the right side of the table. The import schema should be updated/modified in order to import this addition.

This import schema was created based on the original organization of the data. For a further successful use of this schema, please note that the interface settings e.g. CollectionID or ProjectID should be adapted to your installation, as well as other settings like prefixes, postfixes, splitters or filters.
