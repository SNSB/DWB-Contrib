This import schema allows the import of collection data in the fungi collection of the M Herbarium. The import table includes the following information:

-	Specimen Acc. Nr.
-	Location (Country, locality description, coordinates, altitude and collection date)
-	Collector name and collector number
-	Identification of fungi and host plant
-	External identifier (GenBank Acc.No)

This import schema was created based on the original organization of the data. For a further successful use of this schema, please keep in mind that interface settings e.g. CollectionID or ProjectID should be adapted to your installation, as well as other settings like prefixes, postfixes, splitters or filters.
