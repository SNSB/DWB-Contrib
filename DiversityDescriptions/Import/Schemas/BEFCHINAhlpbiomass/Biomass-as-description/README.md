This example imports each data line of the import file as a separate description. In DiversityDescriptions create the project  "Biomass as description" and a descriptor tree with the same name. In the "Matrix Wizard" open the data file BEFCHINAhlpbiomass_Import_Table.txt and use import schema BEFCHINAhlpbiomass_D_Import_Schema.xml.
