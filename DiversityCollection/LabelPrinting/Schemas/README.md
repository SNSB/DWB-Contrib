xslt files for various DWB-Clients used for creating imports and exports and printing labels

# Label Printing XSLT Schemas
This folder contains XSLT schema files used for printing labels. Each XSLT file defines the structure, styles, and transformations required for generating labels tailored to specific institutions or use cases.
## Folder Structure
Each institution has its own subfolder containing the relevant XSLT files. Within each subfolder, you will find a `README.md` file that should provide explanations of the included XSLT files. Please update the README.md file if you add or change a XSLT file.
