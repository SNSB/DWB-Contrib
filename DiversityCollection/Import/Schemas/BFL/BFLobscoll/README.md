This import schema was created for the import of plant observations in the framework of the project "Flora von Bayern". For more information visit http://www.bayernflora.de/web/

The import table includes the following information:

- Location (Collection date, locality description, habitat, altitude, MTB, Coordinates in Gauss-Kr√ºger)
- Observer name
- Identification using a list or entering names
- Analysis data: Floristic status, number of units and area

Any other information that is not included in the defined columns should be added to the free columns at the right side of the table. The import schema should be updated/modified in order to import this addition.

This import schema was created based on the original organization of the data. For a further successful use of this schema, please note that the interface settings e.g. CollectionID or ProjectID should be adapted to your installation, as well as other settings like prefixes, postfixes, splitters or filters.
